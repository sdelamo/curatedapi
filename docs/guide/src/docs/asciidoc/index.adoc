# Curated API Micronaut Java Library

This project is a Java libray to consume the https://curated.co[Curated] API.

The library exposes methods to consume the endpoints described in the https://curated.co[Curated] API documentation:

- http://support.curated.co/integrations/getting-started-with-the-curated-api/[Getting Curated API]
- http://support.curated.co/integrations/fetching-issue-data-with-the-api/[Fetching Issue data with the API]
- http://support.curated.co/integrations/adding-subscribers-with-the-api/[Adding subscribers with the API]

== Configuration

You will need to configure your publication and api key

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
----
curated:
  publication-key: 'XXXX'
  api-key: 'YYYY'
----

Once, you have the configuration in place, the library registers a bean of type `CuratedApi` in the application context.

== Fetch issues

[source,java]
----
CuratedApi curatedApi;

....

Single<Issues> issues = curatedApi.issues();
----

== Fetch single Issue

[source,java]
----
CuratedApi curatedApi;

....

Single<Issue> issues = curatedApi.issue(1);
----

== Add email subscriber

[source,java]
----
CuratedApi curatedApi;

....

 Single<AddEmailSubscriberResponse> response = curatedApi.addEmailSubscriber(new AddEmailSubscriber("steve@apple.com"));
